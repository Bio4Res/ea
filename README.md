# Evolutionary Algorithm

An Evolutionary Algorithm Library

Carlos Cotta, 2023

## Requirements

Requires JDK 17 or higher. 

## Usage 

See `test/TestEA` class for an example of use. 

The configuration of the EA is done via a JSON file (see `run/bitstring.json` for an example).

    <dependency>
    	<groupId>es.uma.lcc.caesium</groupId>
    	<artifactId>ea</artifactId>
  		<version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>

## Applications

The library has been used in the following projects (non-exhaustive list):
